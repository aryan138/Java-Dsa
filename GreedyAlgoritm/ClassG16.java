/*
 * Used in optimization problem where it follows local optimal choice 
 * at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum.
 * 
 * KEY POINTS:
 *  1.  Follows local optimal choice at each stage, with intend to finding global optimum
 *  2.  Feasible solution (Multiple Choice)
 *  3.  Optimal Solution (Best Choice)
 *  4.  Irrevocability: The selected choice cannot be changed once it is made
